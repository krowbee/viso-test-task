# 🍳 FlavorAI — Personal Recipe Discovery Platform

## ✅ Project Overview
This project was part of a technical test from **Viso**, focused on building a smart recipe management app using **Next.js** and **NestJS**.

The goal was to implement a minimal full-stack system for managing recipes, with authentication and CRUD functionality, following the provided technical stack and architecture guidelines.

## ⚙️ What Has Been Implemented

- 🔐 **Authorization** — Implemented access & refresh token system  
- 🗄️ **Database Design** — Created models and relationships with **Prisma ORM**  
- 🍲 **Core Services** — Built base CRUD services for:
  - Users
  - Recipes
  - Categories
- 🛡️ **AuthGuard** — Implemented but not yet fully connected to controllers  
- 🧩 **Session Model** — Designed a structure for handling user sessions

## 📚 What I Learned

This was my **first experience** working with **NestJS** and **Prisma ORM**.  
I completed the work **entirely through official documentation** without using AI assistants like Copilot or ChatGPT.

Throughout the process, I:
- Gained a solid understanding of NestJS architecture (Modules, Controllers, Services)
- Learned to work with Prisma ORM (schema design, relations, and queries)
- Improved my ability to read, understand, and apply technical documentation efficiently
- Discovered that I can **learn and adapt quickly to new technologies** under time pressure

## 🚀 Reflection

Although I didn’t complete all features within the 8-hour limit, this project became an extremely valuable **hands-on learning experience**.

I now have a clear understanding of how to structure a full-stack project with **NestJS + Prisma + PostgreSQL**, and I’m confident that with more time I could complete the remaining functionality.

## 🧠 Notes
I didn’t submit the final result to the company, as I used this test primarily as a **growth opportunity** rather than a formal submission.  
It showed me where my strengths are, and where I can focus next to reach the next professional level.
